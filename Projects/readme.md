## Projects for Quant and Financial Engineering Roles

| Project Name | Description | Tags | Link |
| ------------|--------------|-----|------|
| Black-Scholes Model Implementation | `Build a program that implements the Black-Scholes option pricing model, which is fundamental for valuing European-style options.` |
| Monte Carlo Simulation for Options | `Develop a Monte Carlo simulation to price options, especially useful for complex options with various features and payoffs.` |
| Binomial Tree Model | `Create a binomial tree model for option pricing, particularly valuable for American-style options and options with discrete dividend payments` |
| Volatility Surface Construction |`Construct a volatility surface by analyzing option prices to understand how implied volatility varies with strike and maturity.`|
| Interest Rate Derivative Pricing | `Build pricing models for interest rate derivatives, such as swaps, caps, floors, and swaptions, considering yield curves and interest rate volatility.`|
| Credit Derivative Pricing | `Develop models for pricing credit derivatives, like credit default swaps (CDS), which are essential for managing credit risk` |
| Exotic Pricing Model | ` Explore pricing methods for exotic options, such as Asian options, barrier options, and lookback options, which have non-standard features.`|
| Real-Time Option Pricing | `Create a real-time option pricing system that uses market data to continuously update option prices as market conditions change.` |
| Stochastic Volatility Models | `Implement pricing models that incorporate stochastic volatility, as seen in Heston or SABR models, to better capture market dynamics.`| 
| Portfolio Hedging Strategies | `Design and test hedging strategies to manage the risk of option positions within a larger portfolio context.` |
